# Model LeetCode Solutions

> Itâ€™s very easy to treat LC grinding as a numbers game, but repetition of high quality / frequent problems is key.

-- Anonymous LeetCode user (see [What is a better method to learn LeetCode than just practicing it?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-better-method-to-learn-LeetCode-than-just-practicing-it/answer/Duncan-Smith-23))

This is a collection of C# solutions to LeetCode problems. They are generally based on Java solutions found on the LeetCode discussion boards, where a lot of smart people post creative and elegant code. The idea is to collect efficient model solutions that are short (though not [golf short](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/)), so they can be easily written and explained on the whiteboard during an interview.
